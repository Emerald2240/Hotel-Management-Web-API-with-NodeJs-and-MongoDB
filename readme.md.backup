# Hotel Mangement Web API
In an ongoing hotel management project, the backend developer having looked at the Figma Design is tasked to chunk out some APIs in vanilla javascript using NodeJs and ExpressJs for the frontend to consume.

The database consists of two tables or collections namely: Rooms and Room Types. The room type holds information about the size, luxury, descripting and inventory of the rooms. Each room has a name, price and a single room type.

## How to Install and Run
The above project is a NodeJs/Vanilla JavaScript app that runs with Express. Download the code locally into your machine and ensure you have NodeJs installed on your computer. Once done, open the console inside the folder, and either run *node app.js* or *npm run app*. Make sure you have an active internet connection as the database is hosted online. Once you run the code, you should see a message "Yay! Database connected successfully"
